        <h3>Entity from the ground up</h3>
        <p>
        This tutorial serves as an introduction to using Entity
            for the programmer who is new to basically all of the concepts
            involved. As far as possible, I try to make no assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>This tutorial may contain typos or other errors (but hopefully won't). The
        code snippets should all compile with Visual Studio or Mono's <code>mcs</code>
        (the latter was how I was testing them).</p>
        <p>This tutorial was started when I was in the middle of writing a mail about this
        to someone who was interested and I remembered Scott Hanselman's good advice to
        put everything on a blog rather, just in case it ever has to be repeated (: </p>
        <p>I hope this tut is informative and helpful. Please feel free to leave a comment
        if there's something I've missed or if this has been even remotely useful (: </p>

        <p>Without futher ado, let's dive in!</p>
